# Typescript Setup
Typescript is a compiled language. 

TypeScript is a free and open source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript. (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript )

## To create a Typescript File: 
```
touch index.ts
```

## To install Typescript and TypeScript Node: 
```
sudo npm install -g typescript 
sudo npm install -g ts-node
```

## To compile to JS:
